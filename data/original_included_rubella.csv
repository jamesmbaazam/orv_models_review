We use age-structured compartmental models which divide the population amongst whom the disease is spreading into classes and use partial differential equations to model the spread of the disease. This paper is particularly concerned with an analytical investigation of the effects of different types of vaccination schemes. We examine possible equilibria and determine the stability of small oscillations about these equilibria. The results are important in predicting the long-term overall level of incidence of disease, in designing immunisation programs and in describing the variations of the incidence of disease about this equilibrium level."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""James""=>""Included""}",,

L. and Heijne, J.

The enormous amount of data collected with automated laboratory-based surveillance systems require automated algorithms for detecting unexpected aberrations that may signal infectious disease outbreaks. In this paper, we explore the potential of hierarchical time series models to detect deviations from expected incidence. As these count data are extremely noisy it can be expected that these models are suitable to detect signal from noise and accommodate for possible autocorrelation. The proposed procedure consists of three steps; (1) the model parameters are estimated by empirical Bayes on a training period of, e.g. a year; (2) the expected values are updated for small time steps (e.g. daily) as new data arrive; (3) threshold levels are updated conditionally on the past expected values and an alarm is triggered when the threshold level is exceeded. To test the potential of the models we estimated sensitivity, specificity and timeliness on simulated time series and compared the results with an alternative approach of a linear regression model adjusted for trends and season. We also used two observed series for Rubella notifications and Salmonella infections and compared our findings with the expert opinions on these series. The hierarchical time series models approach shows high sensitivity and specificity and correctly identifies outbreaks at an early stage. This, in our opinion, makes the proposed model a reliable tool for adequate automated detection of infectious disease outbreaks."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""James""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Topic out of scope,Not an outbreak intervention",,

Control efforts for measles and rubella are intensifying globally. It becomes increasingly important to identify and reach remaining susceptible populations as elimination is approached. Methods. Serological surveys for measles and rubella can potentially measure susceptibility directly, but their use remains rare. In this study, using simulations, we outline key subtleties in interpretation associated with the dynamic context of age-specific immunity, highlighting how the patterns of immunity predicted from disease surveillance and vaccination coverage data may be misleading. Results. High-quality representative serosurveys could provide a more accurate assessment of immunity if challenges of conducting, analyzing, and interpreting them are overcome. We frame the core disease control and elimination questions that could be addressed by improved serological tools, discussing challenges and suggesting approaches to increase the feasibility and sustainability of the tool. Conclusions. Accounting for the dynamical context, serosurveys could play a key role in efforts to achieve and sustain elimination."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""James""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Not an outbreak intervention assessment",,

Rubella vaccine was applied since 1969, but tetravalent dengue vaccine is being used in large scale nowadays. In the past, based on unavailable information regarded to rubella vaccine, mathematical models were used to design vaccination schemes in order to avoid congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). Currently, knowing that vaccine does not result in CRS, rubella vaccination is modelled as usual childhood infection. This experience of updated biological knowledge that influenced mathematical modellings of rubella vaccination is taken into account to reflect about the tetravalent dengue vaccine.

J. and Grenfell, B. T.",,eng,,,"Rubella is a completely immunizing and mild infection in children. Understanding its behaviour is of considerable public health importance because of congenital rubella syndrome, which results from infection with rubella during early pregnancy and may entail a variety of birth defects. The recurrent dynamics of rubella are relatively poorly resolved, and appear to show considerable diversity globally. Here, we investigate the behaviour of a stochastic seasonally forced susceptible-infected-recovered model to characterize the determinants of these dynamics and illustrate patterns by comparison with measles. We perform a systematic analysis of spectra of stochastic fluctuations around stable attractors of the corresponding deterministic model and compare them with spectra from full stochastic simulations in large populations. This approach allows us to quantify the effects of demographic stochasticity and to give a coherent picture of measles and rubella dynamics, explaining essential differences in the recurrent patterns exhibited by these diseases. We discuss the implications of our findings in the context of vaccination and changing birth rates as well as the persistence of these two childhood infections."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""James""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Title out of scope,Not an outbreak intervention assessment",,

These papers consider cases in which an optimal vaccination strategy exists. However, in general, the optimal solution identified using the gradient may not be feasible for some parameter values (i.e., vaccination coverages outside the unit interval). In this paper, we derive the analytic conditions under which the optimal solution is feasible. Explicit expressions for the optimal solutions in the case of sub-populations. This is done for general mixing functions and examples of proportionate and preferential mixing are presented. Of special significance is the result that for general mixing schemes, both are bounded below and above by their corresponding expressions when mixing is proportionate and isolated, respectively."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""James""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Attention E,J keeping decision | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Not an outbreak intervention assessment",,

The lack of local MMR data prevents identification of areas with low vaccination rates that would be vulnerable to the spread of disease. We collected county-level vaccination rates for the 2014-2015 school year with the objective of identifying these regions. We requested county-level kindergarten vaccination data from state health departments, and mapped these data to visualize geographic patterns in achievement of the 95% MMR vaccination target. We aggregated the county-level data to the state level for comparison against CDC state estimates. We also analyzed the relationship of MMR vaccination level with county-level and state-level poverty (using U.S. census data), using both a national mixed model with state as a random effect, and individual linear regression models by state. We received county vaccination data from 43 states. The median kindergarten MMR vaccination rate was 96.0% (IQR 89-98) across all counties, however, we estimated that 48.4% of the represented counties had vaccination rates below 95%. Our state estimates closely reflected CDC values. Nationally, every 10% increase in under-18 county poverty was associated with a 0.24% increase in MMR vaccination rates (95% CI: -0.07%; 0.54%), but the direction of this relationship varied by state. We found that county data can reveal vaccination trends that are unobservable from state-level data, but we also discovered that the current availability of county-level data is inadequate. Our findings can be used by state health departments to identify target areas for vaccination programs."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""James""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Not a model,Not an outbreak intervention",,

Vaccinating decisions exemplify a complex, coupled system where vaccinating behavior and disease dynamics influence one another. Such systems often exhibit critical phenomena - special dynamics close to a tipping point leading to a new dynamical regime. For instance, critical slowing down (declining rate of recovery from small perturbations) may emerge as a tipping point is approached. Here, we collected and geocoded tweets about measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and classified their sentiment using machine-learning algorithms. We also extracted data on measles-related Google searches. We find critical slowing down in the data at the level of California and the United States in the years before and after the 2014-2015 Disneyland, California measles outbreak. Critical slowing down starts growing appreciably several years before the Disneyland outbreak as vaccine uptake declines and the population approaches the tipping point. However, due to the adaptive nature of coupled behavior-disease systems, the population responds to the outbreak by moving away from the tipping point, causing ""critical speeding up"" whereby resilience to perturbations increases. A mathematical model of measles transmission and vaccine sentiment predicts the same qualitative patterns in the neighborhood of a tipping point to greatly reduced vaccine uptake and large epidemics. These results support the hypothesis that population vaccinating behavior near the disease elimination threshold is a critical phenomenon. Developing new analytical tools to detect these patterns in digital social data might help us identify populations at heightened risk of widespread vaccine refusal."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""James""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Not an outbreak intervention assessment",,

N.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: Childhood vaccination remains the focus of heated public debate. Parents struggle to understand the potential risks associated with vaccination but both parents and physicians assume that they understand the risks associated with infection. This study was done to characterise how modern vaccination practices have altered patient risks from infection. METHODS: In this modelling study, we use mathematical analysis to explore how modern-era vaccination practices have changed the risks of severe outcomes for some infections by changing the landscape for disease transmission. We show these effects using published data from outbreaks in the USA for measles, chickenpox, and rubella. Calculation of risk estimation was the main outcome of this study. FINDINGS: Our calculations show that negative outcomes are 4.5 times worse for measles, 2.2 times worse for chickenpox, and 5.8 times worse for rubella than would be expected in a pre-vaccine era in which the average age at infection would have been lower. INTERPRETATION: As vaccination makes preventable illness rarer, for some diseases, it also increases the expected severity of each case. Because estimates of case risks rely on data for severity generated during a pre-vaccine era they underestimate negative outcomes in the modern post-vaccine epidemiological landscape. Physicians and parents should understand when making decisions about their children's health and safety that remaining unvaccinated in a predominantly vaccine-protected community exposes their children to the most severe possible outcomes for many preventable diseases.

The reality of competing demands for limited resources leads to trade-offs and questions about the relative value of specific investments. Developing investment cases can help to provide stakeholders with information about the benefits, costs, and risks associated with available options, including examination of social, political, governance, and ethical issues. We describe the process of developing investment cases for globally coordinated management of action plans for measles and rubella as tools for enabling the implementation of the Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP). We focus on considerations related to the timing of efforts to achieve measles and rubella goals independently and within the context of ongoing polio eradication efforts, other immunization priorities, and other efforts to control communicable diseases or child survival initiatives. Our analysis suggests that the interactions between the availability and sustainability of financial support, sufficient supplies of vaccines, capacity of vaccine delivery systems, and commitments at all levels will impact the feasibility and timing of achieving national, regional, and global goals. The timing of investments and achievements will determine the net financial and health benefits obtained. The methodology, framing, and assumptions used to characterize net benefits and uncertainties in the investment cases will impact estimates and perceptions about the value of prevention achieved overall by the GVAP. We suggest that appropriately valuing the benefits of investments of measles and rubella prevention will require the use of integrated dynamic disease, economic, risk, and decision analytic models in combination with consideration of qualitative factors, and that synthesizing information in the form of investment cases may help stakeholders manage expectations as they chart the course ahead and navigate the decade of vaccines.

METHODS: We used health impact models to estimate the economic impact of achieving forecasted coverages for vaccination against Haemophilus influenzae type b, hepatitis B, human papillomavirus, Japanese encephalitis, measles, Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A, rotavirus, rubella, Streptococcus pneumoniae and yellow fever. In comparison with no vaccination, we modelled the costs - expressed in 2010 United States dollars (US$) - of averted treatment, transportation costs, productivity losses of caregivers and productivity losses due to disability and death. We used the value-of-a-life-year method to estimate the broader economic and social value of living longer, in better health, as a result of immunization. FINDINGS: We estimated that, in the 73 countries, vaccinations given between 2001 and 2020 will avert over 20 million deaths and save US$ 350 billion in cost of illness. The deaths and disability prevented by vaccinations given during the two decades will result in estimated lifelong productivity gains totalling US$ 330 billion and US$ 9 billion, respectively. Over the lifetimes of the vaccinated cohorts, the same vaccinations will save an estimated US$ 5 billion in treatment costs. The broader economic and social value of these vaccinations is estimated at US$ 820 billion. CONCLUSION: By preventing significant costs and potentially increasing economic productivity among some of the world's poorest countries, the impact of immunization goes well beyond health."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""James""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Model not mechanistic",,

This study estimates the burden of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) from 1996 to 2001 in this country. METHODS: Three methods to calculate CRS incidence were used. A retrospective search (""Observed cases"") was conducted using hospital discharge records of children born from 1996 to 2001 with selected codes of ICD9 and ICD10 consistent with CRS and children <3 months of age with a positive serologic test for rubella IgM antibody at the National Children′s Hospital (NCH). Cases were classified as either suspected, compatible or confirmed CRS and congenital rubella infection. ""Expected"" incidence of CRS was calculated using reported cases of rubella (women 15-45 years of age) and fertility rates, assuming CRS probability of 0.9 during the first trimester of pregnancy and 0.5 of asymptomatic rubella cases. ""Estimated"" CRS cases were calculated using incidence rates reported from modeling analysis during epidemic and endemic years. RESULTS: Of the 577 discharge charts reviewed and the 66 children reported as rubella IgM(+), 40 compatible CRS cases, 45 confirmed, and 4 with congenital rubella infection cases were identified. The range of annual incidence rate of CRS (per 1000 live births) was as follows: ""Observed"" = 0.00-0.33, ""Expected"" = 0.00-0.35 and ""Estimated"" = 0.5-1.5. Compared with the estimated number of CRS cases, only 27.2% of CRS cases were detected from the retrospective search and 10.1% would be expected when calculated using rubella reported cases. CONCLUSIONS: The under-detection of CRS cases using rubella reported cases in women of reproductive age and retrospective search of CRS reinforces the importance of suspecting CRS in the presence of a single compatible manifestation. Laboratory confirmation is indispensable to implement CRS elimination strategies and should be done in every suspected case. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""James""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Not an outbreak intervention assessment",,

The 1st round tested opportunistically collected sera from pathology laboratories across Australia, a 2nd round was carried out in 2002, and a 3rd round of testing is currently ongoing using sera from 2007-08. This is the 1st systematic evaluation of the ANSP since its inception. Existing information and outputs from the ANSP were reviewed and used in conjunction with data collected from a survey of the program operators to evaluate the overall utility of the ANSP and the following system attributes; acceptability, stability, simplicity, flexibility, data quality, sensitivity, representativeness and timeliness. So far the ANSP has generated 26 peer-reviewed publications and provided useful data that have influenced and provided an evidence base for immunisation policy in Australia; for example informing mathematical models, which identified the need for the young adult measles-mumps-rubella immunisation campaign. However, difficulties have been encountered with obtaining enough samples for testing in the 3rd round currently being undertaken. This is a concern that has the potential to undermine the representativeness and stability of the system, and other methods of sample collection must be investigated. Serological surveillance is an important component of any comprehensive system for monitoring population immunity to vaccine preventable diseases and evaluating the effectiveness of immunisation programs. However, an effective ongoing program requires strong support to ensure it remains sustainable in an era when laboratory based population health research for the public good is becoming increasingly challenging."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""James""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Topic out of scope",,

Following the identification of rubella, which similarly presents with fever and rash and causes congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) in infants born to women first infected with rubella early in pregnancy, modelers also began to characterize rubella disease and transmission. Despite the relatively large literature, no comprehensive review to date provides an overview of dynamic transmission models for measles and rubella developed to support risk and policy analysis. This systematic review of the literature identifies quantitative measles and/or rubella dynamic transmission models and characterizes key insights relevant for prospective modeling efforts. Overall, measles and rubella represent some of the relatively simplest viruses to model due to their ability to impact only humans and the apparent life-long immunity that follows survival of infection and/or protection by vaccination, although complexities arise due to maternal antibodies and heterogeneity in mixing and some models considered potential waning immunity and reinfection. This review finds significant underreporting of measles and rubella infections and widespread recognition of the importance of achieving and maintaining high population immunity to stop and prevent measles and rubella transmission. The significantly lower transmissibility of rubella compared to measles implies that all countries could eliminate rubella and CRS by using combination of measles- and rubella-containing vaccines (MRCVs) as they strive to meet regional measles elimination goals, which leads to the recommendation of changing the formulation of national measles-containing vaccines from measles only to MRCV as the standard of care. © 2016 Society for Risk Analysis."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""James""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Review",,

Insufficient vaccine supplies can necessitate rationing, lead to preventable adverse health outcomes, delay the achievements of elimination or eradication goals, and/or pose reputation risks for public health authorities and/or manufacturers. This article explores the dynamics of global vaccine supply and demand to consider the opportunities to develop and maintain optimal global vaccine stockpiles for universal vaccines, characterized by large global demand (for which we use measles vaccines as an example), and nonuniversal (including new and niche) vaccines (for which we use oral cholera vaccine as an example). We contrast our approach with other vaccine stockpile optimization frameworks previously developed for the United States pediatric vaccine stockpile to address disruptions in supply and global emergency response vaccine stockpiles to provide on-demand vaccines for use in outbreaks. For measles vaccine, we explore the complexity that arises due to different formulations and presentations of vaccines, consideration of rubella, and the context of regional elimination goals. We conclude that global health policy leaders and stakeholders should procure and maintain appropriate global vaccine rotating stocks for measles and rubella vaccine now to support current regional elimination goals, and should probably also do so for other vaccines to help prevent and control endemic or epidemic diseases. This work suggests the need to better model global vaccine supplies to improve efficiency in the vaccine supply chain, ensure adequate supplies to support elimination and eradication initiatives, and support progress toward the goals of the Global Vaccine Action Plan."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""James""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Not an outbreak intervention assessment",,

This has been particularly apparently during the Measles-Mumps-Rubella scare in the United Kingdom. Under a voluntary vaccination policy, vaccine coverage in certain age groups is a potentially complex interplay between vaccinating behaviour, disease dynamics, and age-specific risk factors. Here, we construct an age-structured game dynamic model, where individuals decide whether to vaccinate according to imitation dynamics depending on age-dependent disease prevalence and perceived risk of vaccination. Individuals may be timely vaccinators, delayers, or non-vaccinators. The model exhibits multiple equilibria and a broad range of possible dynamics. For certain parameter regimes, the proportion of timely vaccinators and delayers oscillate in an anti-phase fashion in response to oscillations in infection prevalence. Under an exogenous change to the perceived risk of vaccination as might occur during a vaccine scare, the model can also capture an increase in delayer strategists similar in magnitude to that observed during the Measles-Mumps-Rubella vaccine scare in the United Kingdom. Our model also shows that number of delayers steadily increases with increasing severity of the scare, whereas it saturates to specific value with increases in duration of the scare. Finally, by comparing the model dynamics with and without the option of a delayer strategy, we show that adding a third delayer strategy can have a stabilizing effect on model dynamics. In an era where individual choice-rather than accessibility-is becoming an increasingly important determinant of vaccine uptake, more infectious disease models may need to use game theory or related techniques to determine vaccine uptake. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""James""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Model not mechanistic",,

People of European ethnicity made up the majority of measles cases. Age is a positive risk factor, particularly 0-2-year-olds and 5-17-year-old Europeans, along with increased wealth. Pacific islanders were also at greater risk, but due to 0-2-year-old cases. Despite recent high measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine immunization coverage, overall population immunity against measles remains ~90% and is lower in people born between 1982 and 2005. Greatest measles importation risk is during December, and countries predicted to be sources have historical connections and highest travel rates (Australia and UK), followed by Asian countries with high travel rates and higher measles incidences. Our results suggest measles importation due to travel is seeding measles outbreaks, and immunization levels are insufficient to continue to prevent outbreaks because of heterogeneous immunity in the population, leaving particular age groups at risk. © Copyright 2017 Cambridge University Press."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""James""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Attention X,J keeping decision | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Model not mechanistic",,

Reduction of transmission via universal vaccination can prevent CRS, but inadequate coverage may increase CRS numbers by increasing the average age at infection. Consequently, many countries do not vaccinate against rubella. The World Health Organization recommends that for safe rubella vaccination, at least 80% coverage of each birth cohort should be sustained. The nonlinear relationship between CRS burden and infection dynamics has been much studied; however, how the complex interaction between epidemic and demographic dynamics affects minimum safe levels of coverage has not been quantitatively evaluated across scales necessary for a global assessment. We modelled 30-year CRS burdens across epidemiological and demographic settings, including the effect of local interruption of transmission via stochastic fadeout. Necessary minimum vaccination coverage increases markedly with birth and transmission rates, independent of amplitude of seasonal fluctuations in transmission. Susceptible build-up in older age groups following local stochastic extinction of rubella increased CRS burden, indicating that spatial context is important. In low birth-rate settings, 80% routine coverage is a conservative guideline, particularly if supplemented with campaigns and vaccination of women of childbearing age. Where birth and transmission rates are high, immunization coverage must be well above 80% and campaigns may be needed. Policy-makers should be aware of the potential negative effect of local extinction of rubella, since heterogeneity in vaccination coverage will shape extinction patterns, potentially increasing CRS burdens."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""James""=>""Included""}",,

Surveillance is recognised as a cornerstone of elimination programmes, allowing early identification of outbreaks, thus enabling control and preventing re-emergence. Fever-rash surveillance is increasingly available across WHO regions, and this symptom-based reporting is broadly used for measles surveillance. However, as measles control increases, symptom-based cases are increasingly likely to reflect infection with other diseases with similar symptoms such as rubella, which affects the same populations, and can have a similar seasonality. The WHO recommends that cases from suspected measles outbreaks be laboratory-confirmed, to identify 'true' cases, corresponding to measles IgM titres exceeding a threshold indicative of infection. Although serological testing for IgM has been integrated into the fever-rash surveillance systems in many countries, the logistics of sending in every suspected case are often beyond the health system's capacity. We show how age data from serologically confirmed cases can be leveraged to infer the status of non-tested samples, thus strengthening the information we can extract from symptom-based surveillance. Applying an age-specific confirmation model to data from three countries with divergent epidemiology across Africa, we identify the proportion of cases that need to be serologically tested to achieve target levels of accuracy in estimated infected numbers and discuss how this varies depending on the epidemiological context. Our analysis provides an approach to refining estimates of incidence leveraging all available data, which has the potential to improve allocation of resources, and thus contribute to rapid and efficient control of outbreaks."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""James""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Not an outbreak intervention assessment",,

The models summarize serological profiles by a single parameter, the reproduction number R, which quantifies the level of herd immunity in the population. Results showed that there was cause for concern over the levels of susceptibility to measles, with an epidemic of over 100000 cases likely in 1995/6.

As countries plan RCV introductions, an understanding of the existing burden, spatial patterns of vaccine coverage, and the impact of patterns of local extinction and reintroduction for rubella will be critical to developing effective programmes. As one of the first countries proposing RCV introduction in part with GAVI funding, Madagascar provides a powerful and timely case study. We analyse serological data from measles surveillance systems to characterize the epidemiology of rubella in Madagascar. Combining these results with data on measles vaccination delivery, we develop an age-structured model to simulate rubella vaccination scenarios and evaluate the dynamics of rubella and the burden of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) across Madagascar. We additionally evaluate the drivers of spatial heterogeneity in age of infection to identify focal locations where vaccine surveillance should be strengthened and where challenges to successful vaccination introduction are expected. Our analyses indicate that characteristics of rubella in Madagascar are in line with global observations, with an average age of infection near 7 years, and an impact of frequent local extinction with reintroductions causing localized epidemics. Modelling results indicate that introduction of RCV into the routine programme alone may initially decrease rubella incidence but then result in cumulative increases in the burden of CRS in some regions (and transient increases in this burden in many regions). Deployment of RCV with regular supplementary campaigns will mitigate these outcomes. Results suggest that introduction of RCV offers a potential for elimination of rubella in Madagascar, but also emphasize both that targeted vaccination is likely to be a lynchpin of this success, and the public health vigilance that this introduction will require."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""James""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Not an outbreak intervention assessment",,

While rubella clearly is not the perfect model for pertussis, a review of its history is illuminating. Current rubella vaccination policies resulted from an evolution in scientific understanding. Controversies, including those related to communicability, reactivity, and teratogenicity of the rubella vaccine virus, duration of immunity following vaccination, and protection following reinfection, led countries to use different approaches for national immunization programs. These differences were eventually resolved by clinical and epidemiological research coupled with rigorous scientific debate. Increased scientific understanding of pertussis, its epidemiology, and the effects of the new pertussis vaccines will similarly enable informed decision making on whether to extend pertussis immunization to adolescents and adults."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""James""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Title out of scope",,

Basis for rubella data used in the study is the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta, Georgia. Two deterministic, discrete time interval simulation models for rubella are presented. The first model considers population to be unstructured, and mixing within the total population is homogeneous. The model is then simulated using a set of initial conditions and results are compared to observed occurrences in the real population under study. Initial conditions are then varied to test sensitivity of the model to these variations. Alternative vaccination programs are incorporated to see the effect they have on continuing of the rubella process. Data indicated only 25% of susceptible population need be vaccinated to completely wipe out rubella infection from the population. The second model is an age stratified epidemic model in which homogeneous mixing among individuals is not a necessary condition. Population is divided into seven age groups, each with a different proportion of immunes, death rates, and different rates of contact between groups. It is concluded that the second model provides a more realistic description of the population than the first.

Methods: A descriptive study that analyses the data available at the Immunization Unit in the Public Health at the Ministry of Health was undertaken to reduce the incidence rate and eliminate measles in the Kingdom of Bahrain.

One of the contributory factors in this outbreak may have been that the majority of adult males remained unvaccinated. To plan for a supplementary immunization program (SIP) to elevate the herd immunity level, it is critical to determine the required amount of vaccine and identify the target age groups among males for the SIP. The present study aimed to answer these policy questions, employing a mathematical model and analyzing epidemiological datasets from 2012-2013. Our model allowed us to reconstruct the age- and sex-dependent transmission patterns, and the effective reproduction number during the exponential growth phase in 2013 was estimated to be 1.5. The computed next-generation matrix indicated that vaccinating adult males aged from 20-49 years in 2013, using at least 17 million doses, was considered essential to prevent a major epidemic in the future. The proposed model also indicated that, even with smaller doses of vaccine, the SIP in adult males could lead to a substantial reduction in the incidence of rubella, as well as CRS. Importantly, the present study endorses a substantial background risk of observing another major epidemic from 2018-2019, in which cases may be dominated by adult males aged from 25-54 years, that is, our identified age groups plus a five-year time lag from 2013 to 2018."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""James""=>""Included""}",,

However, as vaccination of infants leads to an increase in the average age at which those who were not immunized become infected, certain rubella vaccination programmes can lead to an increase in the incidence of CRS. In this paper we use a mathematical model of the transmission dynamics of rubella virus to investigate the likely impact of different vaccination policies in Europe. The model was able to capture pre- and post-vaccination patterns of infection and prevalence of serological markers under a wide variety of scenarios, suggesting that the model structure and parameter estimates were appropriate. Analytical and numerical results suggest that endemic circulation of rubella is unlikely in Finland, the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, and perhaps Denmark, provided vaccine coverage is uniform across geographical and social groups. In Italy and Germany vaccine coverage in infancy has not been sufficient to interrupt rubella transmission, and continued epidemics of CRS seem probable. It seems unlikely that the immunization programmes in these countries are doing more harm than good, but this may be partly as a result of selective immunization of schoolgirls. Indeed, in both these countries, selective vaccination of schoolgirls with inadequate vaccination histories is likely to be an important mechanism by which CRS incidence is suppressed (unlike the other countries, which have had sufficiently high infant coverage rates to withdraw this option). Reducing inequalities in the uptake of rubella vaccine may bring greater health benefits than increasing the mean level of coverage."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""James""=>""Included""}",,

By using this kind of model, we obtained the natural- and inter-epidemics periods of the disease. These two quantities are quasi-periods, since we are considering damped oscillations. The above two periods were estimated from rubella seroprevalence data from a small Brazilian community and, based on them, a vaccination strategy in a series of pulses was designed. The vaccination time lag between pulses is related to the natural-epidemics period, instead of the inter-epidemics period, multiplied by a fraction usually less than unity (the security factor). The results for different controlling scenarios showed that a series of pulses vaccination strategy can be a good option for developing countries."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""James""=>""Included""}",,

It is an interdisciplinary specialty concerned not only with prevention of infectious diseases during travel but also with the personal safety of travelers and the avoidance of environmental risks. The field has evolved as a distinct discipline over the last 2 decades. It is represented by an international society - the International Society of Travel Medicine (ISTM) - and by an active clinical group within the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (ASTMH). Those who practice in the field come from a wide range of specialty training experiences; however, it is members of the infectious disease community who have frequently taken the lead in providing the evidence base for practice. Accompanying the growth of travel medicine has been a parallel effort in defining a body of knowledge and standards for its practice. These guidelines set forth the minimum standards for knowledge, experience, and practice in travel medicine and review the major content areas in the field. Travel medicine standards are increasingly based on evidence and are moving away from reliance on the opinion of experts. Where possible, recommendations in this document have been graded using the Infectious Diseases Society of America - United States Public Health Service grading system (table 1) [1]. As a young discipline, however, expert opinion and experience still dominate many of the topic areas, highlighting the need for continued investigation in the field. Setting. Most travel medicine care should be performed in a specialized travel clinic by persons who have training in the field, particularly for travelers who have complex itineraries or special health needs (C-III). Primary care physicians and nonspecialists should be able to advise travelers who are in good health and visiting low-risk destinations with standard planned activities. Knowledge base. The knowledge base for the travel medicine provider includes epidemiology, transmission, and prevention of travel-associated infectious diseases; a complete understanding of vaccine indications and procedures; prevention and management of noninfectious travel-associated health risks; and recognition of major syndromes in returned travelers (e.g., fever, diarrhea, and rash) (A-III) (table 2). All providers should access Web-, text-, and journal-based resources. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides authoritative advice on travel health (http://www.cdc.gov/ travel). Competency in travel medicine. Appropriate knowledge and aptitude for practicing travel medicine may be demonstrated by achieving a certificate of knowledge in the field (table 2). Maintaining competency includes ongoing education and performing pretravel consultations on a frequent and regular basis (B-III). Pretravel risk assessment. The key element of the pretravel visit is a health risk assessment of the trip (A-II) (table 3). This balances the health of the traveler (the traveler's age, underlying health conditions, medications, and immunization history) with the details of the planned trip (the season of travel, itinerary, duration, and planned activities). Spectrum of travel medicine advice. Topics of health education and advice that should be covered for all travelers include vaccine-preventable illness, avoidance of insects, malaria chemoprophylaxis (for itineraries that include a malaria risk), prevention and self-treatment of traveler's diarrhea, responsible personal behavior, sexually transmitted infections and safety, travel medical insurance, and access to medical care during travel (A-II) (table 3). Other topics should be covered as indicated by the risk assessment. Consistent and clear advice that is provided in both verbal and written form will help to increase traveler compliance with preventive measures (A-II). The interaction between traveler and health care provider should be collaborative and affords the opportunity to enhance preventive health knowledge. Records and procedures. (1) Permanent ecords should be maintained for the pretravel visit, including records of traveler demographic data and health history, travel health risk assessment, and immunizations, recommendations, and prescriptions given (A-III) (table 4). (2) Standard procedures for immunization should be followed, including informed consent, vaccine storage, administration, record-keeping, and reporting of adverse events (A-III). Immunization. (I) The pretravel visit should be used to update vaccinations that are routinely recommended according to US schedules and based on the traveler's age and underlying health status (A-I) (table 5). These vaccinations include tetanus, pertussis, diphtheria, Haemophilus influenzae type b, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and influenza vaccinations. Vaccination against hepatitis A and B, poliomyelitis, and Neisseria meningitidis may be recommended for travel, as well as for routine health care. (2) Vaccination against yellow fever is usually indicated for travelers to countries in the zone of endemicity for yellow fever (areas in Africa and South America where conditions are conducive to yellow fever transmission) (A-III). In addition, under International Health Regulations (IHRs), some countries that lie within or outside of the zone of endemicity may require yellow fever vaccination as a condition for entry. Recent recognition of serious adverse events associated with yellow fever vaccination requires that a careful risk-benefit assessment be performed before administration of the vaccine. (3) Hepatitis A vaccination should be considered for all travelers (A-III). Booster doses following the primary 2-dose series are not currently recommended (A-II). (4) Vaccination against Japanese encephalitis, rabies, tick-borne encephalitis, and typhoid fever should be administered on the basis of a risk assessment (A-III). Quadrivalent (A/C/ Y/W-135) meningococcal vaccine should be administered to travelers at risk. It is required by Saudi Arabia for religious pilgrims to Mecca for the Hajj or Umrah. Traveler's diarrhea. Traveler's diarrhea is the most common disease among travelers. Management of traveler's diarrhea includes education and advice about prevention, food and liquid hygiene (A-III), and provision for prompt self-treatment in the event of illness (A-I) (table 6). The elements of self-treatment include hydration; treatment with loperamide for control of symptoms, if necessary (when there is no temperature >38.5°C or gross blood in the stool); and a short course (single dose to 3 days of therapy) of a fluoroquinolone antibiotic (A-I). Antibiotic resistance of enteric pathogens, particularly Campylobacter species, in the destination country needs to be considered. For those travelling to these destinations, as well as for other travelers, azithromycin may be indicated (B-II). Combination treatment with loperamide and an antibiotic may be considered for travelers with moderately severe diarrhea (B-III). Antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for most travelers (A-III). Malaria. (I) Malaria is one of the most severe infectious diseases among travelers (tables 7 and 8). Nearly all cases in travelers are preventable. Methods for prevention and best management of malaria include awareness of risk, avoidance of mosquito bites, compliance with chemoprophylaxis, and prompt diagnosis in the event of a febrile illness either during or on return from travel (A-I). When seeking medical care after return from travel, travelers should be instructed to inform their health provider of their travel history. (2) Travelers at risk for malaria should practice the following measures to prevent mosquito bites: wearing of protective clothing to cover exposed skin, application of repellents, and sleeping in areas protected by netting (preferably impregnated with a residual insecticide, such as permethrin) and screens (A-I). Currently, repellents that contain 20%-50% N, N diethylmetatoluamide (DEET) are considered to provide sufficient protection (B-II). (3) The choice of chemoprophylaxis should be mad following a careful assessment of malaria risk during the trip. In addition, whether the traveler has contraindications to a particular antimalarial should be considered. (4) The malaria risk assessment includes the itinerary, the species of malaria at the destination (and whether the most severe form of malaria, that due to Plasmodium falciparum, is present and whether it is resistant to chloroquine or other antimalarials), the season of travel, activities, duration, and access to medical care. Consultation with the latest resource information is necessary. Personal safety and environmental heath. (1) All travelers should be aware of personal safety during travel and exercise responsible behavior (A-III). Road and pedestrian safety, risk of blood-borne infections, avoidance of animal bites, awareness of the risk of assault, sexually transmitted infections, and moderation in alcohol use should be discussed. (2) Travelers should understand the effects that air, sea, and land travel, sun, altitude, and heat and cold may have on their health. To prevent deep venous thrombosis (DVT), long-haul travelers with journeys of 6-8 h and longer should avoid constrictive clothing around their waist and lower extremities, exercise their calf muscles, and maintain hydration (A-III). Travelers with increased risk factors for DVT may consider wearing below-the-knee support stockings (B-II) or receiving low molecular weight heparin (B-I). (3) Ascent to altitudes of 2500-3500 m (8200-11500 feet) is often associated with various forms of high altitude illness. Staged ascent is an effective way to decrease the risk of altitude illness. Travelers who need to ascend rapidly may take acetaxolamide for prevention (B-I). © 2006 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

M. and Nishiura, H. and Higuchi, T.",,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: Japan experienced a nationwide rubella epidemic from 2012 to 2013, mostly in urban prefectures with large population sizes. The present study aimed to capture the spatiotemporal patterns of rubella using a parsimonious metapopulation epidemic model and examine the potential usefulness of spatial vaccination. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A metapopulation epidemic model in discrete time and space was devised and applied to rubella notification data from 2012 to 2013. Employing a piecewise constant model for the linear growth rate in six different time periods, and using the particle Markov chain Monte Carlo method, the effective reproduction numbers were estimated at 1.37 (95% CrI: 1.12, 1.77) and 1.37 (95% CrI: 1.24, 1.48) in Tokyo and Osaka groups, respectively, during the growing phase of the epidemic in 2013. The rubella epidemic in 2012 involved substantial uncertainties in its parameter estimates and forecasts. We examined multiple scenarios of spatial vaccination with coverages of 1%, 3% and 5% for all of Japan to be distributed in different combinations of prefectures. Scenarios indicated that vaccinating the top six populous urban prefectures (i.e., Tokyo, Kanagawa, Osaka, Aichi, Saitama and Chiba) could potentially be more effective than random allocation. However, greater uncertainty was introduced by stochasticity and initial conditions such as the number of infectious individuals and the fraction of susceptibles. CONCLUSIONS: While the forecast in 2012 was accompanied by broad uncertainties, a narrower uncertainty bound of parameters and reliable forecast were achieved during the greater rubella epidemic in 2013. By better capturing the underlying epidemic dynamics, spatial vaccination could substantially outperform the random vaccination."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""James""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Attention X,J keeping decision",,

Aim: Our aim was to estimate and map the risk of resurgence for measles, mumps and rubella in France. Methods: We used a multi-cohort model combining seroprevalence information, vaccine coverage and social contact data. Results: The overall outbreak risk for France in 2018 was highest for mumps, remained significant for measles despite a recent measles outbreak and was low for rubella. Outbreak risks were heterogeneous between departments, as the effective reproduction numbers for 2018 ranged from 1.08 to 3.66. The seroprevalence, and therefore the risk of measles and rubella infection, differed significantly between males and females. There was a lower seroprevalence, and therefore a higher risk, for males. Infants of less than 1 year would be seriously affected in a future outbreak of measles, mumps or rubella, but the highest overall caseload contribution would come from teenagers and young adults (10-25 years old). Conclusions: The high risk for teenagers and young adults is of concern in view of their vulnerability to more severe measles, mumps and rubella disease and complications."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""James""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Not an outbreak intervention assessment",,

The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors for undervaccination against measles. Patients and Methods: Datasets from two cross-sectional surveys were analyzed by logistic regression models. The surveys had been done prior to and after an intervention aiming to raise measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination rates among children entering primary school in five Bavarian counties. Subjects were 9,582 children aged 6 to 7 years and their parents. Results: Main independent predictors of non-immunization were doctors advising against vaccination (OR 84.8; 95% CI 19.9-360.4), doctors abstaining from advice (OR 6.3; 95% CI 4.8-8.4), and parental reservations due to alternative health beliefs (OR 27.9; 95% CI 17.6-44.1). Conclusion: Doctors advising against measles vaccination and doctors not giving any advice proved to be important risk factors for childhood undervaccination against measles. Future strategies to increase measles vaccination rates in Germany should focus more on family doctors."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""James""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Model not mechanistic,Not an outbreak intervention",,

Three key features common to many biological systems are temporal forcing, stochasticity and nonlinearity. Here, using simple disease models compared to data, we examine how these three factors interact to produce a range of complicated dynamics. The study of disease dynamics has been amongst the most theoretically developed areas of mathematical biology; simple models have been highly successful in explaining the dynamics of a wide variety of diseases. Models of childhood diseases incorporate seasonal variation in contact rates due to the increased mixing during school terms compared to school holidays. This 'binary' nature of the seasonal forcing results in dynamics that can be explained as switching between two nonlinear spiral sinks. Finally, we consider the stability of the attractors to understand the interaction between the deterministic dynamics and demographic and environmental stochasticity. Throughout attention is focused on the behaviour of measles, whooping cough and rubella. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Since that discovery a great deal of research has been carried out in an attempt to identify the virus or viruses responsible for chronic diseases of man and animals. Only the neurological diseases of man are dealt with in this article, but the animal diseases, such as visnamaedi in sheep caused by an RNA retrovirus, and scrapie of sheep and goats, are good models for the study of the chronic neurological diseases of man. Scrapie, moreover, may be caused by the same 'unconventional' virus as the human diseases that resemble it and could be a source of infection for man. In the present state of research the diseases in question may be divided into two groups: those for which the viral origin has been demonstrated, and those for which a viral origin is still only a hypothesis. Each group can in turn be divided into two subgroups: the diseases caused by a conventional virus, and those caused by a communicable agent with unexpected properties, an as yet unknown molecular structure, and termed an 'unconventional' virus. The diseases caused by conventional viruses include subacute sclerosing leukoencephalitis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and the neurological forms of persistent or recurrent infection with the cytomegalovirus, the papovaviruses, and the rubella, chickenpox, zona, herpes and measles viruses. Rabies, lymphocytic choriomeningitis and the Vilyuisk encephalitis virus also deserve mention. The unconventional virus diseases are represented by kuru and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The viral origin of diseases such as multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, acute febrile polyneuritis, progressive epilepsiesm, chronic forms of encephalitis, and Parkinsonian syndrome has not been proved, but these conditions seem more likely to be caused by conventional viruses. As regards unconventional viruses, diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, some senile dementias, and Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome have been transmitted to animals, but this transmission still needs confirmation. Other diseases, such as the Parkinsonian dementia syndrome found on Guam, have never yet been transmitted."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""James""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Title out of scope",,

The Japanese government subsequently recommended voluntary vaccination or rubella antibody testing for young women (15-49 years of age) who were planning to conceive and for adult men, children, and other persons in potential contact with pregnant women at home. However, the expense and time involved for vaccination, antibody testing and visiting a clinic may represent a major barrier to voluntary compliance among this busy demographic. The aim of the current study was, therefore, to examine potential relationships between the social background of Japanese working-age individuals affected by the 2013 voluntary vaccination campaign. Methods: A web-based survey of 1,889 Japanese men and women aged 20-49 years was conducted in early 2014. Statistical analyses were used to explore the associations between social background and testing for rubella antibody and / or vaccination uptake during the previous year. Results: Twenty-four percent of respondents who were planning a pregnancy had been tested for rubella antibody or vaccinated in 2013. However, among those without a current desire for pregnancy, 3% of men and 7% of women, respectively, were tested or vaccinated. Regardless of whether they were planning to conceive, testing for rubella antibodies or vaccination was statistically associated with having acquaintances who had been vaccinated, understanding the government recommendations, and being able to confirm their lack of rubella vaccination history using Maternal and Child Health Handbook records in both men and women. Conclusion: To help eliminate rubella in Japan, additional initiatives need to target Japanese individuals who cannot envisage a direct benefit from vaccination. The results of this study suggest that disseminating the government recommendation to all potentially affected subpopulations, along with maintaining life-time vaccination records might offer a solution to encourage vaccination uptake among working-age adults in Japan, as elsewhere. © 2015 Hori et al.

Nonetheless, despite long vaccination programmes across the world, mumps has not yet been eradicated in those countries: indeed, large outbreaks continue. For example, in Scotland large outbreaks occurred in 2004, 2005, and 2015, despite introducing the MMR (Measles-Mumps-Rubella) vaccine more than 20 years ago. There are indications that this vaccine-preventable disease is re-emerging in highly vaccinated populations. Here we investigate whether the resurgence of mumps is due to waning immunity, and further, could a booster dose be the solution to eradicate mumps or would it just extend the period of waning immunity? Using mathematical modeling we enhance a seasonally-structured disease model with four scenarios: no vaccination, vaccinated individuals protected for life, vaccinated individuals at risk of waning immunity, and introduction of measures to increase immunity (a third dose, or a better vaccine). The model is parameterised from observed clinical data in Scotland 2004-2015 and the literature. The results of the four scenarios are compared with observed clinical data 2004-2016. While the force of infection is relatively sensitive to the duration of immunity and the number of boosters undertaken, we conclude that periodic large outbreaks of mumps will be sustained for all except the second scenario. This suggests that the current protocol of two vaccinations is optimal in the sense that while there are periodic large outbreaks, the severity of cases in vaccinated individuals is less than in unvaccinated individuals, and the size of the outbreaks does not decrease sufficiently with a third booster to make economic sense. This recommendation relies on continuous efforts to maintain high levels of vaccination uptake. © 2017 Hamami, Cameron, Pollock and Shankland."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""James""=>""Included""}",,

A mosquito-borne virus resulting in congenital anomalies is unique, and Zika's ability to cause neurological defects on a large scale was a grim reminder of the Rubella epidemic in the 1950s. Over the past 2 years, studies have provided insight on how Zika virus (ZIKV) infects cells and causes disease, but much remains unknown about the long-Term risks of Zika exposure on infant growth and development. Recent findings The impact of ZIKV on pregnancy extends beyond microcephaly and may only first be identified in infancy. The virus has a long latency in semen and can be transmitted sexually. Transplacental passage occurs through infection of Hofbauer cells in the trophoblast. A major difficulty in management of ZIKV disease is that most infections are asymptomatic and the diagnostic methods are not ideal, making both diagnosis and ascertainment of timing of infection problematic. Several different types of vaccines are in development. Large studies are ongoing to determine the risk and total spectrum of anomalies based on the timing of infection and other environmental exposures. Summary This review will summarize the epidemic, what we have learned, what we hope to learn, and current recommendations for care and management. Copyright © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The presence of the mosquito Aedes species across South and Central America in combination with complementary climates have incited an epidemic of locally transmitted cases of ZIKV infection in Brazil. As one of the most significant current public health concerns in the Americas, ZIKV epidemic has been a cause of alarm due to its known and unknown complications. At this point, there has been a clear association between ZIKV infection and severe clinical manifestations in both adults and neonates, including but not limited to neurological deficits such as Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and microcephaly, respectively. The gravity of the fetal anomalies linked to ZIKV vertical transmission from the mother has prompted a discussion on whether to include ZIKV as a formal member of the TORCH [Toxoplasma gondii, other, rubella virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and herpes] family of pathogens known to breach placental barriers and cause congenital disease in the fetus. The mechanisms of these complex phenotypes have yet to be fully described. As such, diagnostic tools are limited and no effective modalities are available to treat ZIKV. This article will review the recent advancements in understanding the pathogenesis of ZIKV infection as well as diagnostic tests available to detect the infection. Due to the increase in incidence of ZIKV infections, there is an immediate need to develop new diagnostic tools and novel preventive as well as therapeutic modalities based on understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease. © 2017 Mittal, Nguyen, Debs, Patel, Liu, Jhaveri, Kay, Mittal, Bandstra, Younis, Chapagain, Jayaweera and Liu."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""James""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Not a model",,
